# Samples for Qt-based applications

Those samples can be used as a model to develop an application using QT for Python, using "old style" Widgets or QML.

Currently packages in the PyPi/pip repos don't support ARM, so pyside2 components should be installed as debian packages. Check setup.sh in the project folders for a sample.

For QML apps you'll have also to install QML modules, depending on the features you plan to use.

If you run a user-interface you'll need to start the weston container first (check our developer website for more information on this topic).
